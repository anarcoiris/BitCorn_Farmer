# Feature Decoupling Guide

## Problem: Multicolinealidad (High Correlation with Close)

The audit system detected **~10 features with correlation >0.95 with close**, causing:
1. **Redundant information**: Multiple features encoding essentially the same signal
2. **Gradient instability**: Highly correlated features cause training instability in LSTM
3. **Overfitting**: Model memorizes noise instead of learning true dynamics
4. **Poor interpretability**: Impossible to know which features truly matter

### Features Affected (Before Fix)

**Group 1: OHLC** (corr ~0.98-0.99)
- `high`, `low` - By definition close to close in stable timeframes
- `log_close` - Perfect correlation (log transform of close)

**Group 2: Moving Averages** (corr ~0.95-0.99)
- `sma_5`, `sma_20`, `sma_50` - Lagged versions of close
- `ema_5`, `ema_20`, `ema_50` - Exponential averages of close
- `bb_m` - Bollinger middle band (literally sma_20)

**Group 3: Bollinger Bands** (corr ~0.94-0.97)
- `bb_up`, `bb_dn` - Derived from bb_m (which is sma_20)

**Group 4: Fibonacci Levels** (corr ~0.92-0.96)
- `fib_r_236`, `fib_r_382`, ... `fibext_2000` - Calculated from rolling high/low

## Solution Implemented

### Strategy 1: Quick Win (Manual Exclusion)

**File**: `prepare_dataset.py` (lines 475-492)

Immediately remove the most redundant features:

```python
EXCLUDE_HIGHLY_CORRELATED = {
    "high", "low",       # OHLC: ~0.98-0.99 corr
    "log_close",         # Perfect correlation
    "sma_5", "ema_5",    # Too noisy
    "bb_m", "bb_up", "bb_dn",  # Redundant with bb_width
}
```

**Impact**: Reduces feature count from ~50 to ~42 features

---

### Strategy 2: Feature Decoupling (Normalized Ratios)

**File**: `fiboevo.py::add_technical_features()` (lines 432-500)

**New Parameter**: `decouple_from_close: bool = False`

When `True`, transforms absolute features (correlated with close) to relative ratios (decoupled):

#### Transformations Applied:

**1. OHLC → Normalized Ratios**
```python
# Before: high, low (absolute values)
# After:
hl_spread_norm = (high - low) / close  # Spread as % of price
close_hl_position = (close - low) / (high - low)  # Position 0-1
```

**2. Moving Averages → Percentage Distances**
```python
# Before: sma_20, ema_20 (absolute values)
# After:
close_sma20_dist = (close - sma_20) / close  # % distance
close_ema20_dist = (close - ema_20) / close  # % distance
ma5_ma20_ratio = sma5_dist / sma20_dist  # Relative positioning
```

**3. Bollinger Bands → Position Within Bands**
```python
# Before: bb_m, bb_up, bb_dn (absolute values)
# After:
bb_position = (close - bb_dn) / (bb_up - bb_dn)  # 0=lower, 1=upper
bb_width = (bb_up - bb_dn) / bb_m  # Already normalized (kept)
```

**4. Fibonacci Levels → Keep Only Distances**
```python
# Before: fib_r_236, fib_r_382, ... (absolute price levels)
# After: dist_fib_r_236, dist_fib_r_382, ... (normalized distances)
# Absolute levels removed, only distances kept
```

**5. ATR → Normalized by Close**
```python
# Before: atr_14 (absolute volatility)
# After:
atr_14_norm = atr_14 / close  # Volatility as % of price
```

**6. Kept Unchanged** (already normalized):
- `log_ret_1`, `log_ret_5` - Returns (already relative)
- `rsi_14` - Bounded 0-100 (normalized)
- `raw_vol_10`, `raw_vol_30` - Std of returns (relative)
- `td_buy_setup`, `td_sell_setup` - Count features
- `bb_width` - Already normalized
- `fib_composite` - Composite distance metric

## Usage

### In prepare_dataset.py (CLI)

```bash
# Default: Uses quick win (removes 8 redundant features)
python prepare_dataset.py \
    --sqlite data_manager/exports/marketdata_base.db \
    --symbol BTCUSDT \
    --timeframe 30m \
    --seq_len 32 \
    --horizon 10

# With decoupling: Transforms features to normalized ratios
python prepare_dataset.py \
    --sqlite data_manager/exports/marketdata_base.db \
    --symbol BTCUSDT \
    --timeframe 30m \
    --seq_len 32 \
    --horizon 10 \
    --decouple-features
```

### In Python Code

```python
import fiboevo as fibo

# Generate features with decoupling
df_decoupled = fibo.add_technical_features(
    close,
    high=high,
    low=low,
    volume=volume,
    decouple_from_close=True  # Enable decoupling
)

# Result: Features expressed as normalized ratios
# - No absolute price levels
# - All features are % distances, positions, or ratios
# - Much lower correlation with close
```

## Testing

**Script**: `test_decouple_features.py`

Verifies that decoupling reduces correlation:

```bash
python test_decouple_features.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✓ PASS: High correlation features reduced from 10 to 2
✓ PASS: Average correlation reduced (0.7850 → 0.4230)
✓ PASS: All feature transformations applied correctly (4/4)

✓ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

## Expected Impact

### Before (Baseline)
- **High correlation (>0.90)**: ~10 features
- **Average abs correlation**: ~0.75-0.85
- **Effective features**: ~40/50 (20% redundant)

### After Quick Win
- **High correlation (>0.90)**: ~5 features
- **Feature count**: 42 (removed 8 redundant)
- **Average abs correlation**: ~0.65-0.75

### After Full Decoupling
- **High correlation (>0.90)**: 0-2 features
- **Average abs correlation**: ~0.35-0.50
- **Feature count**: ~35-40 (more compact, less redundant)
- **Gradient stability**: ✅ Improved (less colinearity)
- **Generalization**: ✅ Better (features robust to price scale)

---

## Backward Compatibility

**Default behavior unchanged**: `decouple_from_close=False`

Existing code continues to work with no modifications. Only opt-in when ready:

```python
# Old code (still works)
df = fibo.add_technical_features(close, high, low)

# New code (opt-in)
df = fibo.add_technical_features(close, high, low, decouple_from_close=True)
```

---

## Integration with TradeApp GUI

**Future Enhancement**: Add checkbox in Prepare tab

```python
# In TradeApp._prepare_data_worker()
decouple = self.decouple_features_var.get()  # Checkbox state
df_feats = fibo.add_technical_features(
    close, high, low, volume,
    decouple_from_close=decouple
)
```

---

## Audit Compatibility

The audit system (TradeApp → Audit tab) will automatically detect reduced correlation:

**Before decoupling**:
```
WARN very_high_corr_with_future_close - 10 features highly correlated (>0.95)
```

**After decoupling**:
```
OK   corr_with_future_close - No features with extremely high corr (>0.95)
```

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Strategy 3: VIF-based Feature Selection

Implement automatic feature selection using Variance Inflation Factor:

```python
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor

def select_features_by_vif(df, feature_cols, vif_threshold=10.0):
    """Remove features with VIF > threshold"""
    # Iteratively remove highest VIF feature until all < threshold
    # Returns: subset of features with low multicolinealidad
```

### Strategy 4: Attention Mechanism

Implement `LSTM2HeadWithAttention` that automatically learns feature importance:

```python
class LSTM2HeadWithAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        # Feature attention: learns which features matter
        self.feature_attention = nn.Sequential(...)
        # Temporal attention: learns which timesteps matter
        self.temporal_attention = nn.Sequential(...)
```

**Benefit**: Model automatically downweights redundant features
