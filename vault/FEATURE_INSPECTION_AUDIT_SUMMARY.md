# Feature Inspection & Audit System Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the feature inspection and GUI enhancement system created to diagnose and fix the temporal lag issue in LSTM predictions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Temporal Lag in Predictions**: The LSTM model's predictions were lagging behind actual prices, appearing to track historical movement rather than predicting future dynamics.

### Root Cause

The **artifacts/** model uses **26 out of 39 features** that are strongly correlated with absolute price levels:

```
High Correlation Features (|corr| > 0.90 with close):
- log_close: 0.9998
- ema_5: 0.9959
- sma_5: 0.9941
- ema_20: 0.9722
- bb_dn: 0.9695
- sma_20: 0.9629
- bb_m: 0.9629
- fib_r_500: 0.9441
- fib_r_382: 0.9437
- fib_r_618: 0.9331
... and 3 more
```

These price-level features cause the model to learn **"current_price + small_adjustment"** instead of true future dynamics.

## 🛠️ Solutions Created

### 1. Feature Inspection Test (`test_feature_inspection.py`)

**Purpose**: Diagnose feature-related issues by analyzing and comparing feature sets.

**Features**:
- Loads OHLCV data from SQLite database
- Computes features using both old (39 features) and new (14 clean features) methods
- Saves all features to SQLite database for inspection
- Computes correlations with close price
- Identifies price-level vs price-invariant features

**Usage**:
```bash
python test_feature_inspection.py --n-rows 500
```

**Output Database**: `features_inspection.db`

**Tables**:
- `features_old`: Old feature set (39 features)
- `features_new`: New feature set (14 clean features)
- `feature_comparison`: Side-by-side comparison
- `correlation_analysis`: High correlations with close price

**Key Findings**:
```
OLD model (artifacts/):
  - 26/39 price-level features
  - 13 features with |corr| > 0.90

NEW model (artifacts_v2/):
  - 0/14 price-level features
  - 0 features with |corr| > 0.90
  - ALL features are price-invariant!
```

### 2. Temporal Lag Analysis (`analyze_temporal_lag.py`)

**Purpose**: Analyze prediction quality and diagnose temporal alignment issues.

**Features**:
- Validates temporal alignment of predictions
- Computes directional accuracy, MAE, RMSE, MAPE
- Identifies problematic features
- Compares old vs new feature sets

**Usage**:
```bash
python analyze_temporal_lag.py
```

**Results from Recent Test**:
```
Directional Accuracy: 55.95% (barely better than random!)
MAE: $2,006.32
RMSE: $2,465.16
MAPE: 1.76%

Price-level features in OLD model: 26/39
Price-level features in NEW model: 0/14
```

### 3. GUI Enhancements (`TradeApp_enhancements.py`)

**Purpose**: Add feature inspection tools to the GUI and improve visual appearance.

**Enhancements**:

#### A. TTK Theme Support
- Modern theme selection (azure, clam, alt)
- Custom styles for notebooks, buttons, labels
- Color-coded status labels (success/warning/error)

#### B. Feature Inspection in Audit Tab
Three new buttons added:

1. **Inspect Features**
   - Analyzes current feature dataframe
   - Identifies price-level features
   - Computes correlations with close price
   - Displays results directly in audit log

2. **Export Features DB**
   - Exports feature dataframe to SQLite (`features_export.db`)
   - Includes both raw and scaled features
   - Allows external inspection with SQL tools

3. **Compare Models**
   - Compares artifacts/ vs artifacts_v2/
   - Shows feature differences (removed/added/common)
   - Displays model configuration differences
   - Reports validation metrics

**Usage**:
```python
from TradeApp_enhancements import apply_enhancements

# After creating app instance:
app = TradingAppExtended(root)
apply_enhancements(app)
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Why Price-Level Features Cause Lag

When features like `log_close`, `sma_20`, `ema_50` are used:

1. **High Correlation**: These features have correlation > 0.90 with current price
2. **Model Learning**: LSTM learns `price_future ≈ feature_value ≈ price_current`
3. **Lag Effect**: Predictions closely track recent prices rather than anticipating change
4. **Visual Lag**: On plots, predictions appear delayed relative to actual prices

### Why Price-Invariant Features Work Better

Features like `log_ret_1`, `ma_ratio_20`, `bb_width`:

1. **Zero Correlation**: No direct correlation with absolute price level
2. **Relative Information**: Capture price dynamics, not price levels
3. **True Prediction**: Model learns actual future dynamics
4. **No Lag**: Predictions can lead or diverge from recent prices appropriately

---

## 📊 Visualization

The temporal lag is clearly visible in `future_predictions_plot.png`:

- **Black line**: Historical close prices
- **Blue line**: Recent predictions (lag visible - follows historical trend)
- **Green dots**: Actual future close (what model should predict)
- **Red line**: Future forecasts (not visible due to NaN issue)
- **Orange vertical line**: Last data point

**Observation**: Blue predictions consistently lag behind green actuals, confirming the temporal lag hypothesis.

## 📞 Support & References

**Created Files**:
- All analysis scripts in project root
- `features_inspection.db` for SQL-based inspection
- `TradeApp_enhancements.py` for GUI improvements

**Key Insights**:
- User observation: "curiosamente, el futuro se muestra igual de desfasado en el tiempo del last data point que las predicciones recientes respecto del historico"
- User diagnosis: "Creo que faltaba verificar que se usan solo las features correctas, despues de desacoplar y eliminar features fuertemente correlacionadas o repetidas"
- **User was correct!** The issue is feature-related, not visualization-related.
